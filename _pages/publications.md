I am currently doing research in the Viechle Routing Problem area, which has resulted in two papers until now. I'm assisting Sajad Hedayati, a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at Khajeh Nasir Toosi University. We use Adaptive search approaches to solve the problems. I'm responsible for coding and implementing algorithms (like SA, Genetics, Hill climbing, etc.) used in the papers.

Re-supplying mobile parcel lockers in last mile logistics
----
We study the generalized vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows for re-supply mobile parcel lockers at selected locations in a set of fixed routes where mobile parcel lockers are moving on these routes during the day. We first provide a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem and propose an adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm for solving large-sized instances.

Mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the clustered generalized vehicle routing problem
----
The clustered generalized vehicle routing problem (CGVRP) is an extension of the vehicle routing problem in which demand points are grouped into a number of distinct zones. These zones are further grouped into different clusters. The objective of the CGVRP is to find a set of routes that a fleet of vehicles starts at depot and visits exactly one node per zone in a manner that all zones in a cluster should be visited consecutively. This paper proposes three mixed-integer linear programming formulations. literature.
